Detailed Instructions

1. Extract and Align
- Use the weekly topic, learning outcomes (numbered list, with CLOs aligned), and assessments from the course outline.
- Ensure learning outcomes are written using Bloom’s Taxonomy verbs and are aligned to course-level outcomes, labeled (e.g., CLO1, CLO2).

2. Tone & Style
- Use a friendly, student-centered tone.
- Occasionally include a personalised template variable 
   - e.g. Welcome 
       <span class="dp-personalized-token dp-user-short-name-placeholder">
         [Current User Short Name]
       </span>!
- Prioritize clarity and guidance without being verbose.
- Use emojis sparingly, only where they help engagement.
- Include reflective prompts and calls to action.

3. Content Blocks
- Each learning activity or section must be its own content block.
- Use appropriate headings (e.g., Watch, Read, Reflect, Contribute, Discuss, Evaluate).
- Select a valid icon from the Font Awesome Classic Solid library:
https://fontawesome.com/search?ip=classic&s=solid&o=r
(Insert only the icon name in "fa fa-[name]" format.)

4. Placeholders & Personalization
- Wrap all unavailable content (videos, files, links) in <mark> tags.
- Use the personalized greeting token sparingly, e.g.:
<span class="dp-personalized-token dp-user-short-name-placeholder">[Current User Short Name]</span>
Only use once every few pages, typically in the introduction or wrap-up.

5. Discussion Prompts
- Must be explicitly aligned with the week’s learning outcomes.
- Must NOT include personalized tokens.

6. Date Handling
- Never use calendar dates. Refer only to weeks (e.g., “Due in Week 6”).

7. Sources
- Base all content on the attached course outline.
- For context or clarity, you may consult https://wikipedia.org.

Output Format
- Only output the generated pseudo-Markdown content—no explanations, summaries, or extra text.
- Ensure it's clean and easy to paste into a plain-text editor.

WAIT for Input
